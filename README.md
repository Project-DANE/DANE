# The Plan

 - Create README with project goals, project description, initial hypotheses, planning of project, data dictionary, and come up with recommedations/takeaways

### Acquire Data
 - Acquire data from Yahoo Finance Library and dowload the historical data from BTC, DJI, & Gold. Create a function to later import the data into a juptyer notebook. (acquire.py)

### Prepare Data
 - Clean and prepare the data creating a function that will give me data that is ready to be explored upon. Within this step we will also write a function to split our data into train, validate, and test. (prepare.py) 
 
### Explore Data
- Create visuals on our data 

- Create at least two hypotheses, set an alpha, run the statistical tests needed, reject or fail to reject the Null Hypothesis, document any findings and takeaways that are observed.

### Model Data 
 - Create a baseline model of 
 
 - Create, Fit, Predict on train subset on 3 time series models.
 
 - Evaluate models on train and validate datasets.
 
 - Evaluate which model performs the best and on that model use the test data subset.
 
### Delivery  
 - Create a Final Report Notebook to document conclusions, takeaways, and next steps in recommadations for predicitng BTC's Price. Also, inlcude visualizations to help explain why the model that was selected is the best to better help the viewer understand.

| open | Opening price of the asset |
| high | The high price point of the asset  |
| low | The low price point of the asset |



## Steps to Reproduce

- Clone my repo including the acquire.py, prepare.py, explore.py, and modeling.py 

- Put the data in a file containing the cloned repo.

- Run notebook.
